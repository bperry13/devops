Networking Notes ----------------------------------

ping
ssh
curl

//these commands only valid until a restart, for permanent
//changes in etc/network_interfaces file 
ip link //list and modify interfaces on the host
ip addr //see ip addresses assigned to interfaces
ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0 //set ip addresses on the interfaces


ping 192.168.1.0 //looks for a connection to that ip addr
route //display the kernel ip routing table
ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1 //
ip route add default via 192.168.1.1 
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward //if set to 0 then not forwarding, if set 1 then forwarding
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward //changes value to 1 to allow port forwarding

DNS Notes ------------------------------------------
set a name for the ip address locally:
add the line '127.0.0.1  dns_name' to the /etc/hosts file 

point to DNS server which tracks all DNS on a network:
add the line 'nameserver  192.168.1.100' to the file /etc/resolv.conf  

you can set the order of DNS in /etc/nsswitch.conf with a 0 or 1

terminal commands:
nslookup //queries host name from a DNS server. Only queries DNS server, not /etc/hosts/
dig //similar to nslookup but more details
