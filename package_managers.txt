Red Hat Package Manager (rpm) Notes --------------------------------------
rpm -i telnet.rpm //install the package telnet.rpm
rpm -e telnet.rpm //uninstall the package telnet.rpm
rpm -q telnet.rpm //query the package telnet.rpm

rpm doesn't check for dependencies before installing a package. 
For example, ansible requires python. rpm allows you to download ansible 
without python which could cause errors. You might want to use the
yum package manager which does check for dependencies and installs 
them.

Yum Package Manager (yum) Notes ------------------------------------------
yum repolist                       //list of repositories
yum list                           //lists installed or available packages
yum remove                         //removes a package
yum --showduplicates list ansible  //shows all versions of ansible 
yum install ansible-2.4.2.0        //installs specific version with a hyphen
