Node JS Notes -------------------------------

curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -;sudo yum install -y nodejs

node -v //check version
node add.js //run a nodejs program named add.js

npm -v //check version
npm search file //search for packages with file in the name or description

installing npm in a directory makes a node_modules directory and package.json file for metadata
package.json is good for finding dependency errors

node -e "console.log(module.paths)" //list all paths node looks at while importing a package
